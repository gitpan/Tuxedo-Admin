Revision history for Perl extension Tuxedo::Admin.

0.05  Mon Jun 21 23:11:53 2003
  - Version 0.05 is the first public release.  It is not fully-functional, but
    is useful for some tasks, particularly those involving groups and servers.
    The API is not stable and is likely to change based on experience using
    the various modules.  Only tested against Tuxedo 8.1, but I plan to ensure
    that the library works with at least Tuxedo 6.5 and up.  'make test' does
    not currently work, but there are some examples under the t/ directory.
