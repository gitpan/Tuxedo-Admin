Revision history for Perl extension Tuxedo::Admin.

0.06  Wed Jun 25 23:54:13 2003
  - The main reason for this release is to have a working 'make test', so that
    the cpan-testers don't get failed builds.  I'm busy reworking the API so
    that only the parameters required to do a GET are mandatory for the new
    function, rather that all the required parameters for creating a new
    object.  I'm also ensuring that all objects have an exists() method.  More
    documentation is provided, but it is still incomplete and probably
    inaccurate in places.

0.05  Mon Jun 21 23:11:53 2003
  - Version 0.05 is the first public release.  It is not fully-functional, but
    is useful for some tasks, particularly those involving groups and servers.
    The API is not stable and is likely to change based on experience using
    the various modules.  Only tested against Tuxedo 8.1, but I plan to ensure
    that the library works with at least Tuxedo 6.5 and up.  'make test' does
    not currently work, but there are some examples under the t/ directory.
