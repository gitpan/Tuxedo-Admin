Tuxedo/Admin version 0.05
=========================

This module aims to make runtime administration of a Tuxedo environment
simpler and less error-prone than the usual method of navigating the tmadmin,
dmadmin and qmadmin menus or writing multiple adhoc ud32 scripts to make TMIB
calls.

It provides a simple object-oriented Perl interface to the Tuxedo MIBs
allowing the caller to query, add or update the various components of the
Tuxedo environment, such as servers, groups, access points etc.

Version 0.05 is the first public release.  It is not fully-functional, but is
useful for some tasks, particularly those involving groups and servers.  The
API is not stable and is likely to change based on experience using the
various modules.  Only tested against Tuxedo 8.1, but I plan to ensure that
the library works with at least Tuxedo 6.5 and up.  'make test' does not
currently work, but there are some examples under the t/ directory.
